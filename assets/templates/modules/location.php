							Forum Karlín is located in Prague 8, which includes the city district of Karlín, nowadays one of the most dynamic and fastest growing districts in Prague. Karlín benefits from easy access to the city ring road, being located adjacent to the Magistrala, Prague‘s key north-south artery. Prague Vaclav Havel Airport is accessible within ca. 30 minutes by car.
						</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						Present-day Karlín is an affluent district that has recently seen significant gentrification and development activity with visions from many renowned architects and design studios. The result is a tastefully balanced mixture of renovated historical architecture and completely new construction, combined with improved infrastructure and amenities, such as cafés, restaurants and galleries.
